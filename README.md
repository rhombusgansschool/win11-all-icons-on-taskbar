## EnableAutoTray and explorer shell:::{...} don't work
It seems that in 24H2 Microsoft completely broke EnableAutoTray in the registry and control panel menu which can be opened using

    explorer shell:::{05d7b0f4-2121-4eff-bf6b-ed3f69b894d9}

## How does it work?
The installer moves the minified script to your user folder, hides it, and creates a special PowerShell shortcut in the startup folder that runs the script in the background.    
At startup, PowerShell asks Windows to notify it when the UI registers a new program and suspends itself. When the OS triggers it, the script enables ALL programs in the taskbar settings. However, enabling manually disabled programs in the settings can be avoided by changing one line of code (note that it is the minified version that is installed). By default, this is done to avoid problems if MS changes the algorithm for adding new programs.    

Recommendation: don't disable the *Hidden Icon Menu* option so that you can notice that new programs aren't automatically added to the taskbar if MS manages to break this script
![Settings > Personalization > Taskbar > Other system tray icons > Hidden icon menu > Enable](images/icon-menu.png)

## Does it affect PC performance?
When the script is in standby mode, it does **not** affect the CPU and requires only about 30 MB of RAM. When it is running (which is rare and takes less than a second), it uses **much less** than 1% of the CPU. To reduce the already tiny performance impact, a minified script is used and the process is assigned the lowest priority.

## Wanna run it only once without installing/running a WMI-Event in the Background?
Just run `run-once-min.ps1`.
If you want to put the script in your `shell:startup` without changing ExecutionPolicy (aka the easy way):
Put a shortcut.ink into to your `shell:startup` with `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Path\To\Your\Script.ps1"` as destination
